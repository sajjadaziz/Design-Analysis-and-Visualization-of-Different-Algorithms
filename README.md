# Design-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Different-Algorithms
Implementation and visualization of different algorithms.
Algorithms and all other code is implemented in python.
Different dataset is available, based on nodes.
For visualization page, HTML and CSS is used.
To connect Web Page to python code, eel is used.
The algorithms includes:
=> Prim's Algorithm
=> Kruskal Algorithm
=> Dijkstra Algorithm
=> Bellman Ford Algorithm
=> Floyd Warshall Algorithm
=> Clustering Coefficient Algorithm
=> Boruvka's Algorithm
